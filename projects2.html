        <h2>web development</h2>
        <p>If you'd like to have a website built please contact me by email or message on Instagram. My pricing starts at around $100 USD, but may be less or more depending on complexity.</p>
        <p>Most of my current work is very minimalist or more functional in design, such as this website, although I am willing and capable to do more. Here's some of my portfolio:</p>
        <ul class="normal">
          <li><a href="https://idle-trivia--sirsnowy7.repl.co/">Idle Trivia</a>: a very basic trivia game, made with a "load it and leave it" philosophy</li>
          <li><a href="https://character-sheets--sirsnowy7.repl.co/">Character Sheets</a>: a character sheet maker to assist with a tabletop RPG system I made</li>
          <li><a href="https://got-rectangle--sirsnowy7.repl.co/">Got Rectangle</a>: a simple toy/tool I used to make simple programmer art for Game 2</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of my websites excel at portability between mobile devices and desktop size screens, which is a very important quality in the era we live in, and also one of my greatest skills as a web developer.</p>
