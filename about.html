        <h2>who I am</h2>
        <p>I am a 15 year old game developer and programmer. I've been working on games and programming for about 4 years and in that time I've made a few projects.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>what I've made</h2>
        <p>Most of what I've made that's worthwhile is in the Games section of my website, while other stuff which may be impressive, interesting, or useful, is found in the Demos section.</p>
        <p>The most notable games I have made, shown on the Games page, are Skyshot, Game 2, and GET HEAD. Skyshot is notable, at least to me, because it was one of the first "real" projects I made, the first I was proud of.</p>
        <p>The latter two, Game 2 and GET HEAD are more notable for their successes. Both have seen many players around my school, with Game 2 still being played every now and again at the time of writing.</p>

        <h2>my history</h2>
        <p>I started off making stuff in Ruby on the command line, using a Raspberry Pi. I moved on to Python and then learned a lot of HTML and CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. I then went back to Python and made Skyshot, and after that I went back to web development and, more specifically the Phaser API for game development.</p>
        <p>After this was the Construct period of my life. I discovered a web based game engine called Construct 3 and within a week I had my mom spend $100 on a year license. I then worked on a lot for a few months, ranging from a 5 minute, silly platformer game to an arcade style enemy gauntlet, another arcade style enemy gauntlet, and then culminating with GET HEAD.</p>
        <p>GET HEAD is the first project I really tried with, the first project which had a purpose, the first project made to be played. At the time of writing this, GET HEAD is an ongoing game I am currently working on content updates for.</p>
        <p>The reason GET HEAD is so special is because I really cared about the project. I started an ad campaign on my Instagram account, touted my project at school, recruited players. I wanted people to play this and people did. People are, still, playing it. GET HEAD also has an update schedule, which is the first time I've really dedicated myself, rigidly, to a project. GET HEAD made a lot of firsts.</p>
        <p>In April, 2020, I decided to participate in the bi-yearly game jam Ludum Dare, in this case Ludum Dare 46. I didn't place very highly but the experience was very enlightening and I was pretty proud of the game I made, Life of the Party (find it on my games page).</p>

        <h2>my future</h2>
        <p>My plan for the future is to make games full time. If you'd like to help out with that, you can donate on my <a href="http://ko-fi.com/chrislane">Ko-fi</a> page, buy my games once I start selling them, or share my games on your social media or in real life.</p>
        <p>More short term plans include getting on the Xbox market, more practice and studying, making a fully realized metroidvania game (which has been a dream of mine for a while), and, in general, building more games and gathering more fans.</p>
